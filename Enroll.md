# Data Set on Long-term Enrollment Ratios by Country



We construct a complete data set of historical enrollment ratios, subdivided by education level and gender, for 89 countries from 1820 to 1945 at five-year intervals. The original historical data on school enrollments are compiled from various sources. See  [data sources](/OUP/oup_sources.md).

We construct estimates for a significant number of missing cells, especially in the cases of developing countries or former colonies by using interpolation and extrapolation techniques as explained in details in  [Barro and Lee](http://www.amazon.com/Education-Matters-Global-Schooling-Century/dp/0199379238/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1435965474&sr=8-1&keywords=Education+Matters%3A+Global+Schooling+Gains+from+the+19th+to+the+21st+Century)  (2015, chapter 2) and Lee J. and H. Lee (2015).  The historical estimates for 1820–1945 are combined with information from UNESCO publications since 1950 to get a full time series on enrollment ratios up to 2010.

The figures for trend in schoolenrollments, disaggregated by education level and gender, for individual countries from 1820 to 2010 are also downloadable. Every marker in the figures indicates the availability of the original enrollment data for the specific year in the individual countries.
