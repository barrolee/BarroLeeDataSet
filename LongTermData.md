**Data Sets on Long-Run Enrollment Ratios and Educational Attainment**

This data set is accompanying the paper by Lee, Jong-Wha and Hanol Lee, 2016, “[Human Capital in the Long Run,](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jdeveco.2016.05.006)” _Journal of Development Economics_, vol. 122, pp. 147-169.

Download [full data sets](/LeeLee/DataLeeLee.md) on estimated school enrollment ratios from 1820 to 2010 and estimated educational attainment for the total, female and male populations from 1870 to 2010. The estimates are available in five-year intervals for 111 countries.

Data sources of census/survey [enrollment ratios](/LeeLee/LeeLee_enroll_source.pdf) and [years of school establishment](/LeeLee/LeeLee_AppTabA.pdf) are also available.

The data set includes two measures of aggregate human capital stock; one is constructed by assuming a Mincerian log-linear relationship between the number of years of schooling and human capital and a 10% constant marginal rate of return to an additional year of schooling, an alternative measure is constructed by assuming imperfect substitutability between skilled and unskilled labor with the elasticity of substitution, equal to 2. Please refer to the paper for details.

The educational attainment data from 1950 to 2010 are developed from the Barro-Lee Dataset. Please visit the [Barro-Lee data set](http://www.barrolee.com/).
