# 2010 07 July Update

Revised version of the Barro-Lee Educational Attainment Dataset is now available!

- The differences in the estimates between this and the previous version are due to some errors in the previous version. 
These include some data entry, data expansion, completion estimation, and other minor estimation errors. 
There are only minor differences in the average years of schooling data series between this and the previous version. 
A more detailed list of these will be uploaded in this site soon.
- The version (1.1) released on July 2010 is available here.
