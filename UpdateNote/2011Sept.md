<p>The new version (1.2) is now available!</p>
<p>This version (1.2) improves on the earlier version (1.1) by incorporating recently available census observations and correcting inaccurate estimates of completion ratios.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The new census data are now available through UNESCO and national statistical offices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The census data for the following countries are available through UNESCO: Canada, Fiji, Ghana, Guyana, Iran (Islamic Republic of), Maldives, Namibia, Papua New Guinea, Tonga and United Arab Emirates; while the census data for the following countries are available through their respective statistical offices: Macro SAR, Cote dâ€™Ivoire, Guatemala, Italy, Russian Federation, Slovenia, Sri Lanka and United States.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some countries have extremely low or high county specific primary/secondary completion ratios. As these imply unusual trends in the completion ratios, we replaced them by the regional specific primary/secondary completion ratios. These countries include: Afghanistan, Algeria, Austria, Botswana, Democratic Republic of the Congo (only F), Hungary, India, Malta, Myanmar, New Zealand, Portugal (only MF), Sierre Leone, United Kingdom and Zambia.</p>
