### Projections of Educational Attainment by Country
Using the estimates on school enrollment and population structure, we have constructed projections of educational attainment for the population, disaggregated by gender and age group (15–24, 25–64, and 15–64) for 146 countries from 2015 to 2040 at five-year intervals.

We first use the 2010 data on educational attainment by age group as benchmark figures to project the educational attainment of the population by age group for the next three decades. We then estimate the distribution of educational attainment for the younger population, aged 15-24, at the five-year intervals from 2015 to 2040 and then forward-extrapolate the estimates to construct the distribution of educational attainment for the older population groups. For the population structure, we use existing U.N. projections. For the detailed explanation of the estimation method, see  [Barro and Lee](http://www.amazon.com/Education-Matters-Global-Schooling-Century/dp/0199379238/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1435965474&sr=8-1&keywords=Education+Matters%3A+Global+Schooling+Gains+from+the+19th+to+the+21st+Century)  (2015, chapter 3).
