# Data Set on Long-term Educational Attainment by Country

By utilizing the estimates of  [historical enrollment ratios](/enroll.md) from the 1820–1945 period, as well as the available census data and estimates of educational attainment by age for the 1950–2010 period, we have constructed a complete data set of estimates of educational attainment for the total and female populations at the five-year intervals from 1870 to 1945 for 89 countries. For the detailed explanation of the estimation method, see  [Barro and Lee](http://www.amazon.com/Education-Matters-Global-Schooling-Century/dp/0199379238/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1435965474&sr=8-1&keywords=Education+Matters%3A+Global+Schooling+Gains+from+the+19th+to+the+21st+Century)  (2015, chapter 2).

Combining this data set with existing data from  [Barro and Lee](http://www.barrolee.com/) (2013), the data set presents estimates of educate ional attainment, classified by age group (15–24, 25–64, and 15–64) and by gender, for 89 countries from 1870 to 2010 at five-year intervals.
