# Data Sources

We have compiled all available enrollment ratios for primary, secondary, and tertiary levels for the 89 countries from 1820 to 1945 at five-year intervals using the various sources. Where necessary, the underlying data were applied to the nearest five-year date.

Available compendia (Banks and Wilson, 2013; Mitchell, 2003a, 2003b, 2003c; UNESCO, 1958, 1961, 1966; Benavot and Riddle, 1988; Lindert, 2004) provide historical enrollment statistics for many independent states and colonies. Additional historical statistics, especially those on female enrollment, are available from the US Bureau of Education’s Report of the Commissioner of Education (various years), Barnard (1854), and Monroe (1911). We have also compiled data from other sources, including national statistical publications. The historical estimates for 1820–1945 are combined with information from UNESCO publications since 1950 to get a full time series on enrollment ratios up to 2010.
